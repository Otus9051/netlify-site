Hi, I am Otus9051 a.k.a. Steve (not my real name in any means). I first started coding when I was **5** (yes). I was mostly self-taught. My first language(?) was Visual Studio 6.0. My dad taught that (he's a teacher) to his students, and here I am writing down notes on a Diary and then trying to code. Then came HTML, CSS, not JS and hopefully never Java, Python, Go, C, C++, Rust, Bash. Then I got into Android Dev.

Fact: My username's first part: Otus, was the codename of the first device I successfully rooted. The "9051" is our phone number's area code.

Have a good day!

Otus9051
